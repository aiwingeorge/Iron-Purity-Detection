# INTRODUCTION
* It is a ML project used to determine the purity of iron done with Regression.
* In industries and manufacturing processes, ensuring the quality and purity of materials is crucial for maintaining product integrity. The "Iron Purity Detection" project addresses the need for a reliable and efficient system to assess the purity of iron samples using advanced regression techniques. This project employs two powerful regression methods: Linear Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regression. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to create a robust model capable of predicting the purity of iron samples based on relevant features and attributes.
* This dataset is about a flotation plant which is a process used to concentrate the iron ore. This process is very common in a mining plant. The target is to predict the % of Silica in the end of the process, which is the concentrate of iron ore and its impurity (which is the % of Silica). Although the % of Silica is measured (last column), its a lab measurement, which means that it takes at least one hour for the process engineers to have this value. So if it is posible to predict the amount of impurity in the process 
* Through this project, we not only seek to develop an accurate predictive model but also to contribute to the advancement of quality control processes in industries dealing with iron production. The integration of linear regression and SGD regression offers a comprehensive solution for real-time monitoring and assessment of iron purity, thereby improving overall product quality and reducing operational risks

# PROPOSED MODEL
Iron Purity Detection is done using machine learning algorithms. Here are the key points
Data preparation :  Data loading and preprocessing using EDA tools like Pandas , Numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
Algorithms used: 

1)Linear Regression : 
* It is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning , commonly usefd for predicting  a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. 
* It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
* The algorithm aims to find the best fit-line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values
* The basic steps include defining a linear equation (y = mx + b), determining the coefficients 
* (m and b) through optimization methods like least squares, and using the trained model for predictions. 
* The architecture is straightforward, making it a fundamental tool in regression analysis.
2) SGD Regression :
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regression is a variant of linear regression that utilizes the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm  for training.  
* It updates the model parameters based on a randomly selected subset of the training data (mini-batch) rather than the entire dataset. 
* This stochastic updating helps improve efficiency and scalability.
* The algorithm seeks to minimize a cost function, often the Mean Squared Error, by iteratively adjusting model coefficients with a learning rate. 
* The stochastic nature of the updates introduces variability, enabling rapid adaptation to changing data patterns. 
* By the careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, is crucial to balance computational efficiency and stable convergence. 
* SGD Regression finds applications in scenarios where processing the entire dataset at once is impractical, making it a valuable tool for large-scale regression problems.
      
# CONCLUSION
* Automation in Industries: ML models for iron purity detection can be integrated into industrial processes, enhancing automation and reducing human error. This could lead to increased     efficiency in manufacturing.
* Quality Control Improvement: Implementing ML for iron purity assessment could improve quality control measures, ensuring that only materials meeting specific purity criteria are used in production processes.
* Real-time Monitoring: ML models can enable real-time monitoring of iron purity during production. This timely feedback allows for quick adjustments, minimizing the risk of defective products and optimizing resource utilization.
* Supply Chain Optimization: ML models can contribute to optimizing the supply chain by predicting and managing inventory levels based on the expected quality of incoming raw materials.
* Research and Development : Continuous improvement in ML algorithms can lead to more accurate and sophisticated models for iron purity detection, providing researchers with valuable tools for exploring new materials and refining existing ones
